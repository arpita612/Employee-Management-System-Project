# Employee-Management-System-Project
This code implements an Employee Management System using Java Swing for the graphical user interface (GUI). The system allows employees' data to be inserted, updated, deleted, loaded, and searched. The data is stored in a database, which can be managed via a Database class.

1.The system assumes the presence of a Database class to handle the backend operations.
2.Swing components are used for the GUI, providing a desktop application for managing employee information.
3.This is part of a larger system that includes a login form (LoginForm.main()), which is likely used to authenticate users before granting access to the employee management functionality.
